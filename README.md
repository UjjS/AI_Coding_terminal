# AI Terminal Assistant ðŸš€

An AI-powered terminal assistant with a PyQt6 GUI, providing an interactive experience similar to tools like Warp or GitHub Copilot CLI, but with a visual interface for AI interactions, file management, and command execution.

## Features âœ¨

* **AI-Powered Queries**: Ask the AI to perform tasks, write code, explain concepts, etc.
* **Shell Command Execution**: Run shell commands directly from the interface.
* **File Explorer**: Basic built-in file explorer for the current directory.
* **Action Confirmation**: AI can request confirmation for potentially sensitive actions.
* **Dark Theme**: Modern, comfortable dark theme UI.
* **Session Resume**: Ability to resume previous AI conversations (loads from `chat_context.json`).
* **JSON-based AI Interaction**: Structured communication with the AI model.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* An OpenAI API key (set as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
